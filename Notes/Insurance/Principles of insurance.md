# Introduction
Principles of insurance provide guidance to the insurance firms at
the time they are entering into a contract with the person taking
the cover.

**The insurance principles include;**

1.  **Insurable Interest:** This principle states that an insurance claim cannot be valid unless the insured person can prove that he has directly suffered a financial loss and not just because the insured risk has occurred.

3. **Indemnity:**  The essence of this principle is that the insurer will only pay the *“replacement value”* of the property when the insured suffers loss as a result of an insured risk. 
    - The policy puts the insured back to the financial position he enjoyed immediately before the loss occurred. 
    - It does not apply in life assurance since it's not possible to value ones life in terms of money.

4. **Utmost good faith (uberrima fides):** In this principle the person taking out a policy is supposed to disclose the required relevant material facts concerning the property or life to be insured with all honesty.

6. **Subrogation:** In the field of insurance, subrogation is when your insurance company stands in for you and assumes your legal right to pursue an individual or organization for an insurance claim.
  - This principle compliments the principle of indemnity. It does so by ensuring that a person does not benefit from the occurrence of loss.
  - This principle cannot be applicable to life assurance since there is nothing to subrogate.
7. **Proximate cause:** This principle states that for the insured to be compensated there must be a very close relationship between the loss suffered and risk insured i.e. the loss must arise directly from the risk insured or be connected to the risk insured.
